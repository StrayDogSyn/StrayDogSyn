# Hi there, I'm Eric 'Hunter' Petross ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profileâ€”where code meets creativity and a dash of wit! I'm a detail-oriented and collaborative software developer based out of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, with a serious passion for JavaScript, AI/ML innovations, and the ever-fascinating world of LLMs. Think of me as the modern-day Indiana Jonesâ€”if Indiana swapped his hat for a hoodie and his whip for a keyboard.

## About Me

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic learner whoâ€™s always on a quest for new technologies. Whether it's building intuitive web interfaces or diving deep into the latest AI/ML advancements, my motto is simple: *"If it challenges me, it excites me!"* When I'm not debugging code or sculpting seamless UX, you might find me engaging in spirited debates about the best vintage arcade games or marveling at pop-culture references from the golden age of the '90s and early 2000s.

## Technical Skills

I'm comfortable with a wide variety of languages and tools. Here's a snapshot of what I bring to the table:

- **Front-End Web Development:** HTML, HTML Canvas, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, p5.js
- **Web & API Technologies:** AJAX, JSON, API Development, WordPress
- **Testing & Quality:** A/B Testing, RegEx, UX/UI Design
- **Scripting & Automation:** VBA (for Windows), Git for version control
- **Soft Skills:** Technical Writing, Professional Ethics, and a knack for getting things done with a collaborative spirit

I thrive on learning new frameworks and can smoothly transition into emerging tech realmsâ€”whether you're talking about the evolution of LLMs or the next big thing in AI/ML.
