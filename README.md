## üí° About Me

I'm a pragmatic developer who believes in writing clean, maintainable code that solves real problems. My approach combines traditional software engineering principles with modern AI capabilities to build systems that are both innovative and reliable.

**What drives me:** Creating technology that makes a meaningful impact, particularly in justice reform and accessibility. I focus on building robust, scalable solutions rather than chasing the latest trends.

**How I work:** I prioritize clear communication, thorough documentation, and incremental delivery. Whether working solo or on a team, I believe in shipping working software early and iterating based on real user feedback.

**Current focus:** Architecting production-ready LLM applications, implementing RAG systems at scale, and building autonomous agent frameworks that enhance rather than replace human decision-making.
