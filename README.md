# Hi there, I'm Eric 'Hunter' Petross üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile‚Äîwhere code meets creativity and a dash of wit! I'm a detail-oriented and collaborative software developer based out of New England, with a serious passion for JavaScript, AI/ML innovations, and the ever-fascinating world of LLMs. Think of me as the modern-day Indiana Jones‚Äîif Indiana swapped his hat for a hoodie and his whip for a keyboard.

## üöÄ About Me

I'm an enthusiastic learner who's always on a quest for new technologies. Whether it's building intuitive web interfaces or diving deep into the latest AI/ML advancements, my motto is simple: *"If it challenges me, it excites me!"* When I'm not debugging code or sculpting seamless UX, you might find me engaging in spirited debates about the best vintage arcade games or marveling at pop-culture references from the golden age of the '90s and early 2000s.
