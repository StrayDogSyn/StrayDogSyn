# Hi there, I'm Eric 'Hunter' Petross 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile—where code meets creativity and a dash of wit! I'm a detail-oriented and collaborative software developer based out of New England, with a serious passion for JavaScript, AI/ML innovations, and the ever-fascinating world of LLMs. Think of me as the modern-day Indiana Jones—if Indiana swapped his hat for a hoodie and his whip for a keyboard.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a dedicated professional continuously developing new technical skills. Whether it's building intuitive web interfaces or working with the latest AI/ML technologies, I approach each challenge with systematic precision. When I'm not debugging code or crafting user experiences, you might find me engaging in spirited debates about vintage arcade games or discussing pop-culture references from the '90s and early 2000s.
